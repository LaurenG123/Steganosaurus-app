# Steganosaurus-app
***
Steganosaurus is a free, not for profit app, made with the purpose of demonstratings pythons front-end and back-end capabilities. Thanks to the open source kivy framework project, it is now possible to develop multi-touch, multi-playform applications in python for both mobile and web deployments.

### An introduction to staganosaurus: 
"Steganosaurus is a versatile tool that combines the art of steganography with book cipher and also offers the classic Caesar shift cipher with a key of your choosing. 

In the steganography section, you'll begin by uploading an image from your device, followed by providing a URL to a publicly accessible webpage. The first 500 words of that webpage will be harnessed for encrypting your secret message using a book cipher; if a word is missing, it will be replaced with an asterisk (*). Your encrypted message will then be concealed within the image using the powerful Stepic steganography library. To use this application effectively, ensure you grant access to files on your local device. Remember, wield this application responsibly. You can also decrypt your friends photos after upload.
